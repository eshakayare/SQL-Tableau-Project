# SQL-Tableau-Project

# 📦 Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Overview

This project provides a data-driven analysis of a multi-department supply chain system using SQL and Tableau. It aims to uncover operational inefficiencies, identify business risks, and drive actionable recommendations for optimization.

### **Situation**
A company with multiple departments (e.g., Apparel, Pet Shop, Book Shop) was facing challenges in managing order processing, delivery performance, and customer returns. Stakeholders needed clear, visual insights to understand these challenges and identify improvement opportunities.

### **Task**
- Design a relational database to represent supply chain data.
- Query and analyze order, delivery, and return records.
- Export relevant metrics to Tableau for visualization.
- Generate business problems, insights, and recommendations.

### **Action**
- Created an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) to define relationships between orders, departments, and transactions.
- Designed and populated a relational database using MySQL.
- Wrote complex SQL queries to extract insights on processing time, return rates, late deliveries, and monthly order trends.
- Visualized the data in Tableau using interactive dashboards.
- Performed departmental comparisons, ranked delivery performance, and analyzed order status percentages.

### **Result**
- Delivered a comprehensive Tableau dashboard highlighting:
  - Average processing times by department.
  - Department-wise return rates.
  - Late delivery rankings.
  - Total orders by month showing seasonal trends.
  - Distribution of order statuses (e.g., Completed, Pending, Canceled).
- Empowered business stakeholders with clear visual insights to make informed decisions.

## ✅ Business Problems Identified

- Inconsistent late delivery rates across departments.
- Higher return rates in specific departments indicating possible quality or communication issues.
- A significant percentage of orders stuck in "Pending" or "Processing" status.
- Seasonal spikes in order volume without corresponding operational scaling.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- **Optimize Delivery Workflow:** Focus on departments with high late delivery rankings for logistics process improvement.
- **Analyze Product Quality:** Investigate reasons for high return rates, particularly in Health and Book Shop categories.
- **Improve Order Processing:** Streamline internal order management to reduce pending orders and ensure faster completions.
- **Capacity Planning:** Use monthly order trends to forecast and allocate resources proactively during high-demand periods.
